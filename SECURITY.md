## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never commit sensitive data** (API keys, passwords, etc.)
2. **Use environment variables** for all configuration
3. **Validate all user inputs** before processing
4. **Follow the principle of least privilege**
5. **Keep dependencies updated** regularly

### For Users
1. **Use strong passwords** and enable 2FA when available
2. **Keep your browser updated**
3. **Report suspicious activity** immediately
4. **Don't share your login credentials**

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_secret
```

### Security Headers
```typescript
// Implemented in next.config.ts
contentSecurityPolicy: "default-src 'self'; script-src 'none'; sandbox;",
```

## 📋 Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] All environment variables are properly configured
- [ ] Database RLS policies are active
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] Security headers are implemented
- [ ] Dependencies are updated to latest versions
- [ ] API keys are rotated and secure

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Weekly dependency updates
- [ ] Monthly security audits
- [ ] Quarterly penetration testing
- [ ] Annual security policy review

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations
- ⚠️ **API Rate Limiting:** Not fully implemented across all endpoints
- ⚠️ **CSRF Protection:** Missing in some areas
- ⚠️ **Security Headers:** Some headers could be enhanced
- ⚠️ **Input Sanitization:** Some areas need improvement

### Planned Improvements
- 🔄 **Enhanced Rate Limiting:** Implement comprehensive rate limiting
